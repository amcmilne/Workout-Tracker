# Workout-Tracker
For this assignment,  I have created a workout tracker that allows a user to view, create, and track daily workouts.   The user will be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.   The user will also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.   If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user should be able to track their distance traveled.
